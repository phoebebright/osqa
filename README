Fork of The OSQA project - open source Q&A system

Initially just want to upgrade to django 1.8 (still in development).  Should be good for django 1.7 also.
Not going to create a merge django user and forum user into a single custom user as I want to use this with an existing application which already has a custom user.

* The ‘stats’ module sends install info to our OSQA directory, including number of users, number of questions, and the email addresses of the super users.  These email addresses are not sold to any third party.
